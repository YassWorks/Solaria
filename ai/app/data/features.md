# Data description

This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.

There are a few areas of concern at the solar power plant -

- Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
- Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
- Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?
